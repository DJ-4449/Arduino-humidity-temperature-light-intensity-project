# Arduino-humidity-temperature-light-intensity-project
This program will enable the user to read the light intensity, humidity and temperature of the environment wherever he/she finds him/herself.

Project is very simple and uses arduino nano board, DHT11 sensor, LDR sensor, LCD display, a battery and a bunch of wires.
I added battery to the list for the freedom of movement. Then you're able to use the board wherever you go.

Note that these cheap sensors are not very accurate (obviously). But they're good enough.
